# Origin Protocol built as a Substrate Runtime

### The Origin platform
A whitelabel contract for decentralized two sided marketplaces

### Why as a runtime?
SRMLs give flexibilty over Ethereum smart contracts in:
* Forkless upgradability
* Onchain governance out of the box
* Ability to add staking as incentive mechanism
* Ability to add specialized rules for any particular marketplace launched under the core Origin Protocol
* Access to off-chain data via offchain workers
* Proveable Finality with Grandpa
* Easy onramp into Polkadot and its shared security model with Cumulus
* Wont be unintentionally rate-limited by high transaction volume by some other dapp on the same chain (as with Ethereum)
